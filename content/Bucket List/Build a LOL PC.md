## Main Usage
1. Play League Of Legends rank

## My Preference
Since the main usage is to just play League of Legends rank games, the hardware requirement is not that high, plus, I don't like the rgb accessories that make my pc case looks sexy, I opt to go for a low-key pc case. So in my case, I am aiming to build a LOW budget but functional PC that require no extensibility.
1. Build a micro ATX PC that can be portable
2. Budget: US$ 750
3. MOBO has to support WIFI 6

## Regrets
### 1. Should have swap the power supply
I should have swap the power supply with an extensible module supply, since the PC case is quite small and I don't have a lot of fancy stuff. the Deepcool power supply has default wires that cannot be remove base up your need, so it became tricky when trying to tidy up all the unused wires.

### 2. A USB 3.0 90-degree adapter (19 pin )
Connecting the case's USB 3.0 wire to the mobo is impossible due to the Jonsbo C6 case's small size and lack of space for other wires. Therefore, a 90-degree adapter is required.
